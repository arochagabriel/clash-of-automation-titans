🔊 Ladies and gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce this wonderful battle 🤼‍♂️.

  

I'm your host [Gabriel Arocha](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mrgabo) 🤪, and today we're gonna watch two of the most successful automation tools in the market, fighting each other where they are gonna show up who is the best!.

  

Let's meet our opponents!!!

  

# [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

Cypress is a next generation **front end** testing tool built **for the modern web,** despite being often compared to Selenium, Cypress enables you to **write faster**, **easier** and **more reliable** tests. 🤩

  

## Cypress skills: 👊

# [KarateLabs](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate)

Karate is the **only** open-source tool to combine **API test-automation, [mocks](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/blob/master/karate-netty), [performance-testing](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/blob/master/karate-gatling) and even [UI automation](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/blob/master/karate-core) into a single**, _unified_ framework 🤯

# 😠🤜 Fight Rules! 🤛😠

It consists in three rounds:

#### 1️⃣ - API Testing {...} ✅

#### 2️⃣ - UI Testing 🔎 🕵

#### 3️⃣ - General overview ✨

---
  
## 1️⃣  - Round 1 - API Testing {...} ✅

 **Target:** https://gorest.co.in  
 **Type of Api:** Restful.  
 **Methods under test:** GET / POST.  
 **Features to evaluate:** 

- Total time of execution.

- Status and body response validation.

- Schema validation.

- Reusing variables and/or files.

---
  
## 2️⃣  - Round 2 - UI Testing  🔎 🕵

**Target:** https://demo.opencart.com/  
**Browser**: Google Chrome  
**Scenario to automate:**

- Asserts according the requirements.

- POM  / Elements interaction (waits, locators, actions,etc).

## 3️⃣ - Round 3 - General overview 📝 ✨

 - Setting up (How easy is to setup a project and execute) 
 - Code friendly (readilble, simplicity)
 - Comunity Support
 - Reports
